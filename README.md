**Kuusikalenteri** (eng. _The Spruce Calendar_) is my family's Advent Calendar, built by my father from wood and matchstick boxes.

Each morning from the First of December to the Twenty-Fourth of December, my siblings and I would open one of the numbered boxes and find a piece of paper with a puzzle from the **Tonttu** (eng. Christmas Elf). Originally, puzzles varied from ciphers and word search puzzles to picture clues and treasure maps. Later, as we grew older, the puzzles also evolved to more complex forms. Some puzzles even required using outside tools, such as searching for events of a given date or location of coordinates from the internet. No matter how the answer was hidden, it was always a clue pointing towards a location in the house. The last step was then searching the secret location for the prize, a piece of candy or a bar of chocolate.   

As the children of the house started moving out, **Tonttu** started sending the puzzles as text messages, from my father's number for some reason. 2025 was the first year with no children living in our childhood home.

This digitalization project of **Kuusikalenteri** is my effort to keep the Magic of Christmas alive.
