**Kuusikalenteri** (eng. _The Spruce Calendar_) is my family's Advent Calendar. Originally built by my father from wood, matchstick boxes, and glue, it has now been restored in a digital form with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Each December morning until Christmas Eve**, my siblings and I would open one of the numbered boxes and find a piece of paper with a puzzle from the **Tonttu** (eng. Christmas Elf). Initially, the puzzles were simple ciphers, word searches, and treasure maps. But as we grew older, they took more forms, including photos, sheet music, coordinates, or obscure facts requiring Wikipedia to understand. What all the puzzles shared in common, was that the answer always pointed to a location in the house. The last step of each puzzle was therefore to search the secret location for a hidden chocolate prize.

After the first of my siblings moved out, **Tonttu** stepped towards digitalization by sending the puzzles as text messages. 2025 was the first year with no children living in our childhood home. This digitized **Kuusikalenteri** is my effort to keep the Magic of Christmas alive.
